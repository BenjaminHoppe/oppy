    <p>The Original Mission was slated to last a mere 90 days, but opportunity pushed on for an additional 5,160 days before it’s last official transition back home on June 10th, 2018. The rover lost contact due to a planetary wide dust storm which prevented the solar panels from recharging and heating up Opportunity.</p>
