        <p>Opportunity took off on July 3rd, 2003 from launch complex 17 at Cape Canaveral aboard a Delta II heavy rocket and landed on Mars in the Meridiani Planum  206 days later on January 25th, 2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit touched down on the other side of The Red Giant.</p>
      </br>
        <p>The Original Mission was slated to last a mere 90 days, but opportunity pushed on for an additional 5,160 days before it’s last official transition back home on June 10th, 2018. The rover lost contact due to a planetary wide dust storm which prevented the solar panels from recharging and heating up Opportunity.</p>

NASA felt hopeful since the storm has passed and it was usually windy on Mars at this time of year. The best explanation is that Opportunity’s solar panels are covered in a thick layer of dust.</p>

        <p>Opportunity holds the crown for the highest distance traveled by any rover on Mars at 45.16 km (28.06 miles) and has helped humanity make incredible discoveries, like the ones below:</p>
